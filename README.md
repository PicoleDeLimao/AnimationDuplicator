# AnimationDuplicator
A simple program capable of cloning a model animations under a different animation tag (very useful to start modeling alternate forms).
It only accept models in MDL format (if your model is on MDX, you can easily convert using this tool: http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/tools-560/mdlx-converter-62991/).
For more informations, acess the Help menu inside the program.

## Usage
- Choose the MDL input file which you use to clone the animations;
- Choose a MDL output file; 
- Inform the animation tag of the cloned animations (i.e., Alternate);
- Click on "Clone". 

## Dependencies
You only need Java 1.7+ installed on your machine. 

This program use a library called MDL Parser which I also created capable to parsing a MDL model. You can find it here: https://github.com/PicoleDeLimao/MDLParser
